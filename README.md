AI Image editing website which gives background removal and image upscaling, uses RealESRGAN and rembg as AI Models. Shell2http as the backend.
## How it works
When you go in the website you'll see the homepage, in which you have the choice between an AI editor and a Manual editor.

When you choose the AI editor, you'll be able to either remove the background of the image or upscale the image that you upload.

And as for the Manual editor, you'll be able to upload your image and edit it manually or draw on an empty canvas.

## Is there a live demo of this website?
Due to the high costs of renting shared servers, there is no live demo at this moment..
This project requires a shared server with a high performance CPU, we used a free DigitalOcean plan that lasted for around a month to run the website before it inevitably went down.
